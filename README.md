## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was my first time trying to grab data from a form without a submit button, as there is not one in the design. It was a little difficult at first because I didn't understand how a function worked when grabbing data using onchange() or onblur().

### Continued development

I want to figure out how to prevent the input fields margins or padding from increasing when they are active. I found what I thought were several solutions on StackOverflow, but none of them seemed to work.
